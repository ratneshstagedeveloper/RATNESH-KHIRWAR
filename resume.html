                &emsp; &emsp;</u><br>
            <p class="Ratnesh">
                My name is Ratnesh. I believe that every individual has unique characteristics which distinguish them
                from
                others. To be unique you must have an extraordinary spark or skill. I live with my family and my family
                members taught me to live together, adjust, help others, and be humble. Apart from this, I am an
                energetic
                person who loves to play badminton.</p>
            <p class="Ratnesh">
                I have recently joined Kathak classes because I have an inclination towards dance and music, especially
                folk
                dance and classical music. I believe that owing to the diversity of our country India, it offers us a
                lot of
                opportunities to learn and gain expertise in various sectors.</p>
            <p class="Ratnesh">
                My great-grandfather was a classical singer and he also used to play several musical instruments. His
                achievements and stories have inspired me to learn more about Indian culture and make him proud. </p>
            <p class="Ratnesh">
                I am a punctual and studious person because I believe that education is the key to success. Academic
                excellence could make our careers shine bright. Recently I secured second position in my class and my
                teachers and family members were so proud of my achievement. </p>
            <p class="Ratnesh">
                I can manage my time because my mother taught me that time waits for no one. It is important to make
                correct
                use of time to succeed in life. If we value time, then only time will value us. My ambition in life is
                to
                become a successful gynaecologist and serve for human society.</p>
            <p class="Ratnesh">
                Hence, these are the qualities that describe me the best. Though no one can present themselves in a few
                words still I tried to give a brief about myself through this essay. In my opinion, life is meant to be
                lived with utmost happiness and an aim to serve humanity. Thus, keep this in mind, I will always try to
                help
                others and be the best version of myself.</p>
